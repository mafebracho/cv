Hola! I am **Mafe** and I am a Web and iOS developer. My knowledge includes frontend and backend technologies and, in addition to my technical skills, I bring +6 years of experience in planning, designing and coordinating interdisciplinary architecture projects. I don't build houses anymore, but if you want a developer that builds apps and strong and meaningful relationships in your team, get in touch and say ["hola!"](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-fernanda-bracho/?locale=en_US)
